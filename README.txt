Segment Analytics for WordPress. Event tracking integrated into hundreds of 3rd party tools, see segment.com | Free WooCommerce, Ninja Form & Gravity Form integrations. | Re-written & extended by https://in8.io

== Description ==

Persio Analytics for WordPress. Free WooCommerce, Ninja Form & Gravity Form integrations.
Uses Persio's official PHP libraries for Server Side events, as well as a lot of other features functionality.
I completely rewrote this plugin from the previous version.
Client side and server side tracking.
Client side events fire upon validation (ie, for submissions)
Server side events are scheduled and happen asynchronously, so users don't have to wait for processing of these events, it won't slow them down.

There are annotations throughout the plugin to explain the different features.

* Set a User ID based on user custom field, email, or WP user id
* Built-in support for WooCommerce, Ninja Forms, Gravity Forms and WordPress native events.
* Re-name events, choose what traits to include in Identify calls, etc...
* Supports client side (JS API) and server-side tracking (PHP API)
* Ability to filter out roles, custom post types and the admin area
* Easily include userID and email properties in track calls
* Ability to include custom user traits in identify calls using meta keys

== Hooks ==

You can use the following filters, please return the correct values.

- "segment_for_wp_change_user_id" ($user_id): Return a user id.
- "segment_for_wp_change_user_traits" ($traits, $wp_user_id): Return an associative array of traits.
- "segment_for_wp_change_event_properties" ($properties, $action, $data): Return an associative array of properties.
- "segment_for_wp_change_product_properties" ($properties): Return an associative array of product properties (for WooCommerce).
- "segment_for_wp_change_order_properties" ($properties): Return an associative array of order properties (for WooCommerce).

Happy to extend it, let me know.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin zip file through the Plugins section of your site.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Enter your Segment API keys into the plugin and choose your events/settings.

== Upgrade Notice ==

If you're upgrading between version 1.0 to 2.0:
You will need to reconfigure the plugin again, so test it first and backup before upgrading.
The new version of the plugin is much much better, but you will need to set it up again.

== Screenshots ==

1. Supports client side (JS API) and server-side tracking (PHP API)

3. Easily include userID and email properties
4. Many other options for Identify calls
5. Support for Ninja Forms and Gravity Forms

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. What do I need? You will need to signup for Segment.com. You will need a Segment JavaScript source and a PHP Source.
2. How much does it cost? Plugin is free. Segment is free up to 1,000 users.
3. Will it slow my site down? Depends. The more destinations and the more events you use, the slower things can go. The same way as if you installed the scripts directly.
